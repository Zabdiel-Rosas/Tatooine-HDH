Remote:

Init:

The command init is used to start git in an existing repository. So you can use git commands on it.



Clone:

git clone is a command that let us clone a repository that is allocated on github so we can have and exact copy of it and modify the repository from our computer if needed.


Add:

This command let us stage our modified and new files to say to git that we are going to include this changes on our commit.


Commit:

git commit is for saving our changes with one identifier on our local machine to upload the changes later to our remote repository.


Push:

With this command the user upload all the changes that he made under an identifier, so if he has more commits every single one of them will be uploaded to the remote repository.


Pull:

git pull let the user get all the files that are in the remote repository on his local machine.

git merge is used when we want to fusion two or more branches in order to have all the versions in one.



--Name the GIT Phases and what happens on every one of them:

	The first phase of git is untracked and it is when git has no idea of an existing or modified file.
	Next phase is the staged file which is when we add a modified or new file to the stage area in order to tell git
	that we consider these files to be included in our next commit. So now the third step is when we commit our changes,
	this means that our files are going to be under an identifier and saved in our local machine. The last but not least is
	the tracked phase where our files are now tracked by git and it recognizes the changes that we did to our repository.

--What are the things that we sholdn't do on a GIT repository?
	
	One of the most important things to consider all the time is that we must not push our changes to the main (previously known as master) branch, because it could cause in considerable errors for everyone working on the repository. Another thing to avoid is creating a lot of branches, it could cause confusion for us and others.
