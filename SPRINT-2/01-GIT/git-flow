# GIT FLOW

### Untracked Files
When adding new files, deleting existing ones or make a modification on files in the repository, git doesn't recognize the files so it is said that those files are in the untracked phase.

Here's an example of this phase:

### Git Status (This is not a phase of git)
	
Before we continue to see the other phases of the git flow it is important to learn how we can see our files status. This command is really important because it is likely that more than one time we forget what it is the state of our repository and we can see it using _this command:_

> git status

### Staged

 The staged area is where we put our untracked files in order to tell git that we are considering to put this changes on our repository so we are preparing them to be commited later, or in other words, to take a snapshot of this version of the project.

> In order to put our modified files in the staged area it is necessary to write the _git add (modified file)_ command in our terminal.

* After adding our files to the stage we call them staged files.


### Tracked 


Right after adding our changes to the stage, we can say that our files are tracked by git because know git knows what they are and his status.





### Commit Phase

So after adding our modified files to the stage, we will have this scenario:

![files ready to be committed](https://miro.medium.com/max/3092/1*a3rRETgrZ4qw49wALFGzww.png)

Next important to do if we are sure that we want to keep with this operation is using the command:

> git commit 

Right after you type the command you will see something like this on your terminal:

![making the coment of your commit](https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*h1ej_AOz3JK5kaiKT4uwag.png)

> This is the part where you write the description of the commit that you are about to create.
