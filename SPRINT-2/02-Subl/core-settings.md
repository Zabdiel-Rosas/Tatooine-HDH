# Core Settings of Sublime Text 3

### What are these settings on Sublime?

There are a lot of options when it comes to sublime text settings, we can visualize a text file with the core settings of sublime and another right by its side that is for user preferences, this last file overrides the core settings. 

We have different options when it comes to customize our experience using sublime so we can find diferente types of settings, for example we can find the text format and view. So in order to change the font size for example, we have to write the property and its new value in the user preferences file.

A great thing to be grateful of, is the fact that the file with the core settings comes not only with the settings but with comments explaining what they are for as well. Also we have different options for different operating systems, like Windows or MacOs. 

__Tab completition, different encoding types or scroll speed__ are other properties that we can find on the settings file, of course there are some settings that does not make a great impact and others that change completely the performance of the text editor. If you change or not your theme for Sublime it's nothing to be worried about, in the other hand if you change the language of the text editor for one that you don't actually understand it would drive you nuts.


Some of the more important settings in my opinion are these:


| Property | What it does|
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| detect_indentation | Set to false to disable detection of tabs vs. spaces on load |
| auto_indent        | Calculates indentation automatically when pressing enter     |
| auto_match_enabled | Controls auto pairing of quotes, brackets etc                |
| show_definitions   | When enabled, hovering over a word will show a popup listing all possible locations for the definition symbol. Requires index_files. |
| show_errors_inline | Shows build errors just under the line on which they occur.|
| ignored_packages   | List any packages to ignore here.|
